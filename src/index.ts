/**
 * A tiny but capable push & pull stream library for TypeScript and Flow.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Wonka is a lightweight iterable and observable library and exposes a set of helpers to create
 * streams, which are sources emitting multiple values, which allow you to create, transform, and
 * consume event streams or iterable sets of data.
 *
 * It's loosely based on the Callbag spec: {@link https://github.com/callbag/callbag}
